## Skyrim Special Edition


### [NOIR - Nice Overall Improvement Requiem](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=noir)

NOIR is meant to serve two purposes: first, to introduce players to the world of Requiem inside of an environment full of enhanced graphics and new gameplay options; second, to serve as a potential base for veteran modders that wish to add various overhauls such as AZTweaks, 3Tweaks, and other complex mods.

### [TSO - Total Skyrim Overhaul](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tso)

TSO is a finely-tuned modlist based on Requiem v1.9.4 and AZ Tweaks. Almost everything has been modified by hand, and is meant to be a challenging experience unlike any you’ve had before. This is very much a game you are meant to experience for yourself without asking for a walkthrough, so be prepared to die a lot while you learn how best to handle the new mechanics.

### [RGE - Relics of Hyrule - Grand Admiral Thrawn Edition](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=rge)

For those that have had enough of the “lore-friendly” lists and want something different, RGE boasts a massive 900+ mods, featuring items, characters, and references from both The Legend of Zelda and Star Wars universes.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Relics of Hyrule](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12244)

[Skyrim Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17915)  

***

### [Elder Souls](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=eldersouls)

Elder Souls is an attempt to bring some Soulsborne flavor to Skyrim. You should expect challenging but fair combat, an awesome dark fantasy vibe, and a plethora of new content.

Among this content you will find a variety of new hand-placed monster types, multiple player houses in each hold, and a multitude of new dungeons and quests. Leveling and death are modeled after the Dark Souls system, substituting Gold for Souls, meaning you must gain money and sleep in order to raise skills and level up.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Adamant - A Perk Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191)  
[Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839)  
[Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549)  
[Legendary Skyrim Crossbows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8273)  
[Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)  

***

### [Total Visual Overhaul (TVO)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tvo)

The only Wabbajack list to focus solely on graphics. The vast majority of textures are 2K, with 4K textures being used sparingly on large objects where appropriate. The end result is a modlist that looks significantly better than vanilla while still getting great FPS on modern hardware.

No gameplay additions means there's no perk overhaul, no new quests, no new weapons or armor. This also makes it relatively easy to use as a base for your own additions, provided you know how to use tools such as zEdit and xEdit.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Obscure's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514)  
[JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289)

[Cities of the North - Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34168)  

***

### [Elysium](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=elysium)

From TitansBane, the author of [Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612), comes Elysium: what started as a simple off-shoot of The Phoenix Flavour has grown into its own massive undertaking. Elysium has taken its predecessor and packed it full of more content, including mods like [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802), [Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194), a full suite of [EnaiSiaion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191)’s mods, and an optional MO2 profile that supports all of your Creation Club content - all without sacrificing the stability that TPF is known for.

***

### [Tales From the Northern Lands](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=TalesFromTheNorthernLands)

Tales from the Northern Lands is a list that focuses primarily on offering a stylized look similar to Borderlands, the Tales of/from … or the TellTale Walking Dead games. A very welcome side effect of this is that it will even run on older hardware like a GTX 950 and possibly lower. And for people that are only interested in the visual changes made by the list, there is a “Basics” profile included you can use customize to your liking*. This is for if the various gameplay tweaks make the game too much of an easy “power fantasy” for you.

*Please note that Luca (the modlist author) does not support changes to the list, as this Basics profile was only made by request.*

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[SPERG - Skyrim Perk Enhancements and Rebalanced Gameplay](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14180)  
[True Dragonborn - Uncapper Preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27400)  

***

### [Skyrimified](https://www.gitlab.com/trawzified/skyrimified)

Originally based off Lexy's Legacy of the Dragonborn modlist, this list aims to expand on it while cranking up the visuals to eleven and containing popular community requested mods fitting my vision of Skyrim. This makes for a list with a big amount of content, but it also requires a very high end system.

For an overview of the various mods included [there's a trailer available that showcases a large part of the important mods.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUR67HYdXeQ)

### [Keizaal](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=keizaal)

Keizaal is a simple modlist that focuses on improving what is already presented to us in vanilla Skyrim without compromising Bethesda’s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011.

Keizaal also features a more in-depth overview of all its features that can be found [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=keizaal).

### [The Phoenix Flavour](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tpf)

Automated installer for [The Phoenix Flavour](https://thephoenixflavour.com/), this is a list that would be considered a Vanilla+ experience and focuses on greatly improved graphics and enhancing existing gameplay mechanics instead of outright replacing them.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191)  
[Blade and Blunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549)

***

### [Living Skyrim](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=living_skyrim)

Living Skyrim aims to breathe life to the familiar emptiness of Skyrim, bringing tons of new characters to meet and interact with. Pair this with the new quests and character options, and you get a roleplay-focused and immensely replayable list.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Genesis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23871)

***

### [Serenity 2](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=serenity)

Serenity 2 is a Skyrim SE modlist that aims to bring a fresh Requiem Experience to the table. It uses Requiem 4.0.1 converted to Skyrim Special Edition and has minor and some major tweaks to the core Requiem experience that aims to enhance longevity and replayability while keeping the game fair, balanced and looking great. Serenity is targeted at new and veteran Requiem players and can offer new experiences to both sides of the playerbase. The list should run well on 1440p by utilizing 2K textures everywhere.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)  
[Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281)

***

### [QWEST!](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=qwest)

QWEST! was born after a few friends were talking about how some of their friends couldn't enjoy cool quests in modded Skyrim, even with Wabbajack, due to the hardware requirements. This list has very few graphical enhancements which can be removed if you find you're struggling to run it.
It is Legacy of the Dragonborn centered with additions like music, animations, many new lands, many vanilla quest enhancers, better looking NPCs, unique followers and much more, tested to be ran perfectly fine by people with 2GB of VRAM graphic cards.
2 Profiles exists so you can choose between EnaiRim and SimonRim.
Survival mods such as The Frozen North, SunHelm and Campfire are toggleable.

## Fallout 4

***

### [Fallout 4: Enhanced Edition (F4EE)](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=fallout_4_enhanced_edition)

F4EE is a hardcore experience built around Horizon. Survival difficulty is a mainstay for this list. Ammo, food, and water will all be much harder to find, and you’ll have to really think on your feet and take things slow if you want to survive. Overcoming great challenges is the name of the game here. Settlement building is a core mechanic of F4EE, and you will have a much more difficult time without it.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Horizon](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17374)  
[Better Locational Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3815)  
[Immersive Fallout](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30151)  
[VAFS Redux - Bullet Time and Manual Critical](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36519)  

***

### [Sim Settlements Experience](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=ssem)

This modlist is created entirely by a member of the Sim Settlements team, and is meant to be a showcase for both the mod itself and its vast array of potential additions. Really great list to build on top of, provided you don’t want the fuss of sorting through all the SS expansions and prefer to have that section done for you.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Sim Settlements](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872/)  
[Sim Settlements - Conqueror](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37000)

***

### [Boston Cream Pie](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=boston_cream_pie)

BCP sticks to a fairly “Vanilla+” experience, with the intention of adding only historically lore-friendly mods to Boston. If you’ve seen it in a previous Fallout game - or maybe even just read some obscure bit of Fallout lore on the wiki - odds are good you’ll find it somewhere in this list.

**_Mods to get familiar with:_**

[Wasteland Ballistics](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42757)  
[Workshop Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35005)  

***

### [GhoulOut](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=ghoulout)

All of the main quests have been replaced by zombies. And all of the NPCs. And creatures. And bugs. And most everything else. Has a nice custom-made perk system, though. Settlement building is a core mechanic in this list as well. Build your bases to defend yourself and your citizens from zombie hordes, and venture out into the wild when you need to find some more perks for yourself.

It goes without saying that this list is not lore-friendly, and has embraced that fact by also adding things like Deathstroke’s armor, Halo ODST armor, and a variety of other hand-placed oddities you can find throughout the land.

***

### [Magnum Opus](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=magnum_opus)

This list aims to greatly expand the content of Fallout 4 while keeping the original game fully intact. Featuring hundreds of new weapons and armors, dozens of quests and locations, tons of gameplay tweaks, and a custom sorting system, Magnum Opus will do its best to allow you to have fun in whatever way you want while still providing a moderate challenge.

***

### [Welcome to Paradise](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/info?machineURL=tpf-fo4)

Simply put, this list is what Fallout 4 should have been on release. Touting dozens of fixes, improved performance through rebuilt precombines, a custom expanded sorting overhaul, and a wide variety of customization options, Phoenix Flavour: Fallout is the definitive answer for someone that wants to experience the game as it was meant to be played.

### [Ultimate VR Essentials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PhkPbhh0d8_ZoKj5mGBpmUIMU10c_7P94X9FpIuyak/edit)

### [Librum for Skyrim SE and VR](https://github.com/apoapse1/Librum-for-Skyrim-VR)

A re-imagining of Skyrim as a hardcore survival-adventure experience in a gritty, unforgiving landscape, in the tradition of Requiem, YASH, and OOO. Implements hundreds of new quests and locations, reimplements all of Skyrim's mechanics, and completely overhauls the graphics and atmosphere, but tightly integrates it all into the Librum vision.
